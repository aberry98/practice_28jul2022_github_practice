#### another test

this is a test (no pounds)

**bold**

_italics_

* one item 
* item 2 
* item 3 
  * subitem 1 
  * etc 
1. number 1

# code chunk options

1. echo=FALSE
     - means it will run but not show code
2. eval=FALSE
      - means show the code, but don't show the running of the code
3. https://yihui.org/knitr/options/ has more options
4. inline code

##Inline code example below

`r nrow(cars)` # r is needed; the output is 50 (becuase that's the answer to the question)

Cars has `r nrow(cars)` rows.

    
This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
#echo=FALSE means don't show the code
```

```{r pressure2}
plot(pressure)
#echo=FALSE means don't show the code
```



Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
